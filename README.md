# Image Recognition Predictive Models.
I've combined machine learning and web development to create Image Recognition Predictive Models.

This is the first kick-start and it tooks 6 hours to coding and testing the models. I'm using tensorflow as the machine to predict the image, and also some search and help from any source.

Build in pure javascript and some dependencies.

Dependencies:
1. Tensorflow models coco-ssd 
https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tensorflow-models/coco-ssd
2. Tensorflow/tfjs 
https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tensorflow/tfjs
3. React.js 
https://www.npmjs.com/package/react
4. React-dom 
https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-dom
5. React-magic-dropzone 
https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-magic-dropzone
6. React-scripts 
https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-scripts
